*ATS for Candidates - CS 490 Capstone Project*

**Duration**: 15 minutes

---

## Preparation

Every team member needs to be prepared to run the demo on their device. I will randomly choose someone from your team to run the demo. That person does not have to be the presenter, but their device will be used for the presentation.

The team must be prepared with appropriate account names (email addresses), API keys configured, production deployment URLs, and demo content ready. Have a text file ready with content to paste into forms (i.e. copy-and-paste).

The demo should be bug free and running in the production environment.

Scoring for being prepared:
- Running on the proper device, 5 points. Running on another device zero points.
- Being prepared with content, 5 points. **Have the application deployed to production with all API integrations configured, user data populated, and monitoring dashboards accessible**. Minus one point for when an item is not available.
- The demo is bug free, 5 points. Minus one point for every bug that occurs during the demo.

Scoring for the demo:
- One point for each item below marked as "Demo Action".
