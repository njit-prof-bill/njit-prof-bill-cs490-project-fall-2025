# Project Summary

My thoughts after finishing the fall semester on the ATS project

### 1. **Bad UI**

This is the big one for me. Of the 14 groups attacking this project none of them successfully designed an easy to use app. They didn't understand that the app's features extended the user's profile and job board. Instead, they treated each sprint as separate projects and bolted on features using buttons and menus. The resulting apps were difficult to navigate.

### 2. **Duplicate requirements across sprints**

The PRD frequently had duplicate or conflicting requirements. This can be seen with topics like salary information. Salary features are part of three different sprints, but it wasn't clear to the students how these features were connected. Salary is just one example.

### 3. **Third Party API features were not practical**

The PRD requested features from LinkedIn, Indeed, and other companies that do not have robust public APIs that are freely available. Students found themselves relying on AI prompts to make up for their inability to use APIs. In places where third party APIs would be better than AI (national labor bureaus, news.org, etc) the students were prompting with AI instead. The PRDs need to be better about finding and using free APIs.

### 4. **Unable to properly demo sprint work**

I had intentionally made the project large because prior semester's students have accomplished project too easily. But it turned out that the PRD included far more features than could be demonstrated in a 15 minutes sprint demo. The PRD needs to be trimmed such that the work can be easily and demonstrated. PRDs should include creating data and content for the demo.

### 5. **Not clear how subsequent sprints build on earlier work**

As mentioned earlier students UI were a mess of features bolted on with buttons and menus. This was very apparent where there were duplicate requirements, such as with Salary analytics. During demos the students struggled to find all the places to show their work. The PRDs did not make it clear how subsequent features should be added to existing UX in order to make a streamlined experience for the user.

It may be beneficial to describe the final vision such that student can design an extensible app.

### 6. **Over reliance on AI**

The app was intentionally intended to be AI focused. But the students relied on prompts where API calls could serve them better (or cheaper). This was exasporated by the PRDs inclusion of APIs that require commercial licensing. AI should be restricted to write resumes, cover letters, and providing advice.
