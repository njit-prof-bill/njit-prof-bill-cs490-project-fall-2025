# Sprint 4 - Professor Feedback Summary

**Compiled from 78 student retrospectives (Sprint 4, Sections 101 & 103)**
**Date: December 2025**

---

## Most Common Feedback Themes

### 1. **Tickets/Requirements Issues** (Very Common - ~40+ mentions)

**Problems with AI-Generated Requirements:**
- Sprint guidelines should not be AI-generated - they were often unclear, convoluted, or contradictory
- Many tickets overlapped or were redundant within and across sprints
- Some tickets asked for nearly contradictory or redundant functionalities
- UC explanations were vague and caused confusion on demo day
- What was expected on demo day often differed from what the sprint PRD specified
- Many UCs implemented were not shown on demo day (felt like "RNG" whether work would be showcased)

**Scope and Workload:**
- Too many tickets per sprint - felt overwhelming even with AI tools
- The scope should be reduced - too many features for a realistic website
- The website became bloated with more features than necessary
- Not enough work shown in demos relative to tickets completed
- Several features built and debugged never made it into the demo

**Suggestions:**
- Fewer tickets or scope them more tightly
- More unique tickets with less redundancy
- Ensure work invested actually gets represented in demos
- Clearer, more coherent ticket descriptions

---

### 2. **Time Management & Project Timing** (Very Common - ~35+ mentions)

**Start Earlier:**
- Project should start earlier in the semester
- First few weeks were lessons that could have been explained faster or skipped
- Starting earlier would prevent cramming into 1-2 week sessions per sprint
- Would allow for longer sprints or more sprints with fewer tickets each

**Finals Week Conflict:**
- Having to finish during finals week when students are busiest
- Exams took priority, making it difficult to work during that time
- Project landing during exams was a huge blocker for many teams

**Sprint Duration:**
- Sprints were too short for the amount of work required
- Longer sprint times would help
- Not adequate time given to complete required tasks

---

### 3. **Demo Length & Format** (Common - ~15+ mentions)

**Demo Problems:**
- Demos went too long (until almost 10pm is not feasible)
- Too many things to present in one sprint
- Uncertain whether there should be fewer tickets or more sprints
- Number of tickets committed to didn't match actual demo expectations
- Heavy workload but only a portion shown in demo

**Demo Day Confusion:**
- Instructor expected something different than what sprint PRD said
- Discrepancy between demo requirements and UC requirements
- Had to make tweaks to fit demo script after completing tasks per requirements

---

### 4. **Deployment & Technical Challenges** (Common - ~20+ mentions)

**Deployment Issues:**
- CI/CD Pipeline wasn't fully working
- Difficult transition from locally hosted website to one with permanent URL
- Deployment became difficult due to late database changes
- Database changes late in sprint complicated testing and integration
- Many bugs appeared when trying to deploy
- Last-minute PRs caused error messages on demo day

**Integration Challenges:**
- Integration issues when merging overlapping features
- Problems with shared components, API endpoints, and database schemas
- Some integration problems when working on overlapping areas
- Need for stricter cutoffs for late changes as project grows in complexity

---

### 5. **What Students Liked** (Positive Feedback)

**Project Relevance:**
- Project is extremely relevant to CS students' lives (job tracking, interviews, etc.)
- Solving real-world problems that people actually have
- Practical and useful application
- Good for resumes - full-stack application with multiple frameworks

**Learning Experience:**
- Learned how to actually deploy a production web application
- Exposure to industry-standard languages and tools
- Learned about cloud-based tools and app management
- Good practice with GitHub and real-life SWE tools
- Valuable experience working in team environment with tight deadlines
- AI integration was good practice
- Forced to learn many new things
- Project-based nature made class more enjoyable and engaging

**Team Collaboration:**
- Daily standups were very helpful
- Good team communication and coordination
- Learning about teamwork in industry setting
- Design of sprints and demos was good

---

### 6. **In-Class Time Usage** (Occasional - ~5+ mentions)

**Suggestions:**
- More efficient use of in-class time
- Some class days should be set aside for just working on the project
- Especially helpful for first sprint since setup takes a while
- Earlier decision-making around project structure needed

---

### 7. **Course Structure & Support** (Occasional - ~8+ mentions)

**Appreciated:**
- Enjoyed talks before the project started
- Professor was enjoyable and enthusiastic
- Project being fully self-driven from beginning to end
- Challenging project with uncommon features

**Concerns:**
- Amount of features required made it hard to balance with other classes
- Some features were unrealistic and very time consuming
- Need for better file structure or more time to plan
- Would appreciate more coherent overall requirements

## Summary Statistics

- **Total Retrospectives Analyzed:** 78 students
- **Sections:** CS490-101 and CS490-103
- **Sprint:** Sprint 4 (Final Sprint)
- **Primary Concerns:**
  1. AI-generated tickets (clarity, redundancy, contradictions)
  2. Project timing (start earlier, avoid finals week)
  3. Workload scope (too many tickets/features)
  4. Demo length and format

---

## Key Recommendations from Students

1. **Start the project earlier** in the semester to avoid finals week crunch
2. **Reduce the number of tickets per sprint** OR extend sprint duration
3. **Eliminate AI-generated requirements** - make them clearer and more coherent
4. **Remove redundant/overlapping tickets** - ensure each ticket is unique
5. **Align demo expectations with sprint requirements** - reduce confusion
6. **Shorten demo sessions** or reduce features presented per sprint
7. **Provide more in-class work time**, especially early in project
8. **Set stricter cutoffs** for late changes to prevent deployment issues

## Overall Sentiment

Despite the challenges, students overwhelmingly appreciated:
- The **real-world relevance** of the project
- The **hands-on learning experience** with industry tools
- The **team collaboration** aspects
- The **deployed, functional final product**

Most students felt the project was **valuable and educational**, but that **better time management, clearer requirements, and reduced scope** would significantly improve the experience.
